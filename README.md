# Online and scheduled controllers available on Vatsim network
How to plan your flight to align with online controller availability
 
When you are planning a flight, and if you prefer online ATC via VATSIM, you can use this tool to do a "best guess" of who is going to be online when you arrive at your destination. The file will also provide a nice overview of which departure airport to select, to have best coverage.

Some controllers will prebook their online session in various global tools giving us the information on intended availability. Others will login to an online session without any previous activities to commit to availability, which is perfectly understandable. This file will pull information of both scenarios, and combine them in a convenient overview, where you will be able to select the departure and destination of your flight, considering where the most coverage will be available.

**How to**
Download the latest release, and unzip to a folder at your convenience. No need to put in community folder or similar. It is a standalone excel file that pulls data from web, to give you an overview using Power Query, filters and other Excel standard functionality.
