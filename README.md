# FlightSim_ControllerAvailability
 Plan your flight to align with online controller availability
 
 When you are planning a flight, and if you prefer online ATC via VATSIM, you can use this tool to do a "best guess" of who is going to be online when you arrive at your destination. You will also have a nice overview of what departure airport to select, to have best coverage.
