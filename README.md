# Online and planned controllers available on Vatsim network
 Plan your flight to align with online controller availability
 
 When you are planning a flight, and if you prefer online ATC via VATSIM, you can use this tool to do a "best guess" of who is going to be online when you arrive at your destination. The file will also provide a nice overview of which departure airport to select, to have best coverage.

Some controllers will prebook their online session in various global tools, and some controllers will login to an online session without any previous activities. This file will pull information of both scenarios, and combine them in a convinient overview, where you will be able to select the departure and destination of your flight, considering where the most coverage will be available.

**How to**
Donwload the latest release, and unzip to a folder at your convinience. No need to put in community folder or similar. It is a stand alone excel file that pulls data from web, to give you an overview using Power Query, filters and other Excel standard funtionality.
